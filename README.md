# [Tinyjam](https://github.com/mourner/tinyjam) starter

## ðŸš€ Quick start:

[Click here to use this template](https://github.com/noahmarro/tinyjam-starter/generate), use a [.zip download](https://github.com/noahmarro/tinyjam-starter/archive/main.zip), or run these commands:

```
# Clone project
git clone https://github.com/noahmarro/tinyjam-starter.git

cd tinyjam-starter

npm i               # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Watch for file changes and build
```

You can then drag and drop `dist/index.html` in your browser. <br>
Or serve `dist` with a tool like [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve): `npx serve dist`.

### Generate your site :

```
npm run build
```

Your static site waits patiently in the `dist` folder to be hosted
